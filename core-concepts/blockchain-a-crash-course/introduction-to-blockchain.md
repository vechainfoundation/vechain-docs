# Introduction to blockchain

## What is a blockchain?

A blockchain is a shared database or ledger that is distributed among a network of nodes. Blockchains are primarily used to maintain and store transactions in a secure, immutable and transparent way.

## How does a blockchain work?

Blockchains are composed of blocks. Each block contains a set of transactions, as well as a unique code called a "hash" that identifies the block and links it to the previous block in the chain, this is achieved through cryptography. When a block is added to the blockchain, it is verified by the network's participants, who use complex algorithms to ensure that the transactions it contains are accurate and legitimate. Once a block is validated, it is added to the blockchain permanently and it cannot be modified or deleted.

## What are blockchains used for?

Blockchains have a wide range of potential uses across various industries. This is due to their unique features such as decentralization, transparency and immutability. Blockchains are currently used for a variety of applications, including cryptocurrencies, digital assets, digital identity, gaming, supply chain management, and voting systems, among others. As blockchain technology continues to evolve and mature, it is likely that we will see many more innovative use cases emerge in the coming years.

## Who operates the blockchain?

Blockchains are decentralized networks that operate on a peer-to-peer basis, meaning that there is no central authority that controls the network. Instead, the network is operated by a collection of users, who collectively validate transactions and maintain the integrity of the blockchain.

## Why do we need blockchains?

Blockchain technology provides a number of benefits that traditional centralized systems cannot.

* **Decentralization:** Blockchains are decentralized networks, which means that they are not controlled by a single entity. There is no central point of failure which makes blockchains more secure and resistant to fraud or tampering.
* **Transparency:** Every transaction on the blockchain is recorded on a public ledger that can be viewed by anyone. This makes the system transparent and accountable, as every participant can verify the authenticity of the transactions.
* **Immutability:** Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be changed, modified or deleted. This makes the system tamper-proof and ensures the integrity of the data.
* **Security:** Transactions are secured through cryptography and are therefore tamper proof.
* **Efficiency:** Blockchains can automate many processes and eliminate the need for intermediaries, which can make transactions faster and cheaper.
