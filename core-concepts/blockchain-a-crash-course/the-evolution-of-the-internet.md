## Web1 - Read Only

This refers to the first generation of the web, which was characterized by static web pages and limited interactivity. It was mostly used for sharing information and basic communication. Consider it as a small number of people, with the technical capability, creating content for a larger audience.

## Web2 - Read & Write

This refers to the current generation of the web, which is characterized by dynamic, interactive web applications that enable users to collaborate and share content in real-time. Social media, online shopping and cloud computing are all examples of Web2 applications. Think of it as removing the technical barriers of Web1 and allowing anyone and everyone to interact with the internet, or be a content creator. The cost of removing the technical barriers has resulted in a centralization effect with large platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, owning and controlling your data and content.

## Web3 - Read, Write & Execute

This refers to the next generation of the internet, which is currently being created. It is comprised of decentralized, peer-to-peer networks and blockchain based technologies that enable users to take control of their data and interact directly with each other without the need for centralized entities. Web3 applications include dencentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and fungible tokens.

Web3 also incorporates other emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things IoT). The goal of Web3 is to create a more open, transparent and secure internet that empowers individuals and promotes innovation.

## What are the benefits of Web3?

Web3 has the potential to create a more decentralized, democratic, and transparent internet that empowers users and protects their privacy and data.

* **Decentralization:** The most signification benefit of Web3 is that it is decentalized, meaning that there is no central authority or control over the network. This makes it more resistant to censorship, hacking and other forms of attacks, which is particularly important for protecting user data and privacy.
* **Trust and Transparency:** Web3 relies on blockchain technology and smart contracts, which are transparent and tamper-proof. This means that users can trust the data and information from the network, without having to rely on intermediaries or third-party authorities.
* **Interoperability:** Web3 is designed to be interoperable, meaning that different blockchain networks can communicate and interact with each other. This allows for the creation of dApps that can leverage the capabilities of multiple blockchains.
* **Ownership and Control:** With Web3, users have greater ownership and control over their data and digital assets. This is because the decentralized architecture of the network eliminates the need for intermediaries, which often retain control and ownership over user data and assets in traditional Web2 applications.
* **Incentives and Governance:** Web3 is often designed with incentives and governance mechanisms that encourage user participation and collaboration. This is because the network is operated by a community of users, rather than a centralized authority, which creates a more democratic and participatory environment.

## What are the current limitations of Web3

* **Barriers to entry:** As with many nascent technologies, the tools and applications aren't mature enough yet to reach the levels of inclusivity Web3 needs.&#x20;
* **Lack of regulation:** As much as governments have been proactive in trying to understand blockchains and Web3, tailor made regulations are still lacking.&#x20;
